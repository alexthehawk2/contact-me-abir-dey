This is just a project that I did while trying to implement my knowledge regarding HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js.

I've deployed this simple contact me form in Heroku using Mailchimp's API which sends user submitted data to Mailchimp's Subscribed audience list which enables me to contact those users back.

If you're reading this you can also contact me on Instagram @ig_alexthehawk incase you have any suggestions or query.

Thanks for reading! Have a great day ahead.
